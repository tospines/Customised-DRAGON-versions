Example input files accounting for the production of antinuclei in a 2D model of the gas density and source distribution and a 3D model (following the Steiman-Cameron et al distribution - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1460).
These input files allow the reproduction of the main fluxes and ratios for which we have experimental measurements (e.g. CNO fluxes, B/C, Be/O, Li/C, etc...) and give a prediction on the flux of antinuclei expected at Earth.

The files "run_2D_AntiD-DM_XSconstraints-NoPenalties" and "run_2D_AntiD_XSconstraints" are two examples of runs with transport parameters that reproduce all the light secondary cosmic rays. In the former, the spectra antideuteron and antihelium-3 from a WIMP with 100 GeV mass are computed. In the latter, all the nuclei chain, from Si to antiprotons, is taken into account in a model that reproduces the spectra and ratios of all these particles at Earth.
Similar to the "run_2D_AntiD_XSconstraints files", the "run_3D-Full_Steiman_Sigma0.5_H6" input files reproduce all CR observables of CRs from Si to antiprotons but taking into account the 3-D arm distribution of the gas and sources in the Galaxy.
