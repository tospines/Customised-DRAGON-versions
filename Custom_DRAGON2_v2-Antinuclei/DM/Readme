Tables with the production spectrum (i.e. differential distribution, dN/dE) of antideuteron and antihelium-3, generated with Pythia v8.3. 
we derive the input tables for DRAGON2 through the simulation of a colorless electrically-neutral resonance decay with the mass of the WIMP that we are interested in. 
Then, we count the number of particles that have been created within a sphere in momentum space that is $\leq p_c$. Concretely, as obtained from the fits to accelerator data (ALEPH - PRLB 639, 192, 2006) by Ref. PRL126, 101101, we set $p_c = 215$~MeV and $p_c = 243$~MeV for antideuterons and antihelium-3, respectively.
In our computations, we account for the production from displaced antinuclei events and include the enhancement of the branching ratio of production of $\overline{\Lambda}_b$ particles found by Ref. PRL126, 101101. This increase of the branching ratio makes the spectrum produced from the decay of $\overline{\Lambda}_b$ particles be $\sim3$ times larger and is motivated to reproduce the measurement by LEP of the transition ratio f(b \rightarrow \overline{\Lambda}_b). The tables ending with *_tune are those corresponding to the tables accounting for LEP results (see Particle Data Group, Eur. Phys. J. C 3, 1, 1998), while the others are those extracted from Pythia without the enhancement of the branhing ratio of $\overline{\Lambda}_b$ particles.

Zipped are the PPPC tables (http://www.marcocirelli.net/PPPC4DMID.html) in readable format by DRAGON for antideuteron, positron and antiproton production from various channels and masses.
