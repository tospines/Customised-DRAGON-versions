This is a new customized version of the public DRAGON2 code which implements the production of antideuteron and antihelium-3 in the nuclei network. Both, the production of these antinuclei from collisions of cosmic rays with interestellar gas and thei production from a WIMP annihilating or decaying is incorporated. The tertiary contribution is also taken into account.
To activate the option of propagating this particles, the user must add in the .xml file the following flag:

The secondary production of antinuclei takes, as input, tables of cross sections from p+p, p+He, He+p, He+He and ap+p interactions. As default, these tables are those calculated as described in ......Ref here........, that are allocated in the "data" folder.
Likewise, the default tables for the annihilation spectrum (dN/dE) of these antinuclei are given in tables. The tables calculated by the DRAGON group are the default option and are stored in the "DM" folder, along with those from the PPPC tables (http://www.marcocirelli.net/PPPC4DMID.html) for antinuclei. 
For secondary production, we incorporate the option to give other tables defined by the user (in the same format as the default tables that are in the data), which must be specified in the input .xml file with the line: "". Then, the tables name and path should be speciefied. 
This is an example:

In addition, instead of tables of inclusive cross sections, there is the option of giving tables of multiplicity, such that DRAGON takes it and multiply them by the inelastic cross sections of these particles to get the inclusive cross sections. To make use of this option, the flag... should be added to the xml file.

There is also the option of giving only a table

For WIMP production, the user only must specify the path and name of the table (in the same format as the DRAGON2 default tables, in the DM folder), as in this example:

Some other upgrades have been done with respect to former version of the customized-DRAGON code (https://github.com/tospines/Customised-DRAGON-versions/tree/main/Custom_DRAGON2_v1): 
  - Antiproton cross sections scaling factors
  - Positron and leptons tables of secondary production from a user...
  - Scale factors for the cross sectins of B, Be, Li and F production can be given as input parameter in the .xml file. An example is:
  - 3D distributions tested. example with spiral arm distributions.
  - Minor bugs found related to the model of the spatial-dependence of the diffusion coefficient were corrected.
