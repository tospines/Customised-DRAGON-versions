This folder includes:

  - Routines for the fit of the B/C flux ratio with the DRAGON2 cross sections for two different parametrisations of the diffusion coefficient ("Source" and "Diffusion" hypotheses)
  that differ in the origin of the hardening in the CR spectrum. It also containes the Webber (WNEW03) cross sections with the Source hypothesis.
  These are employed and reported in Luque et. al, arXiv:2101.01547 and Luque et al., IN PREPARISON.
  
  - Example routines for the computation of the diffusion coefficient, including magnetosonic modes, based on the plasma properties.
